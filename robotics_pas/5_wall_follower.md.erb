title: "PA: Wall Follower"
desc: "Robot looks for nearest wall follows it"

## Purpose

* This assignment will get you using the LiDAR in more sophisticated ways
* You will also learn how to control the robots movement for a more complex task

### What I hope you will learn

* Get more sophisticated in working with LiDAR data
* Process and filtering sensor noise
* Using math (especially geometry) to solve real world robotics problems
* Use PID processing to make the robot behave reasonably
* Simple state management to control the behavior of the robot


## Assignment

* Write ROS code that allows your robot to follow a wall or perimeter. You are free to refer to hints for inspiration, and are encouraged to experiment with novel ideas. 
    * Write ROS code to have the robot find a wall
    * Drive up to 1.0 meters of it
    * Turn and start following it at that distance.

### Steps

* Publish movement commands to a robot in Gazebo simulation
* Subscribe to the LiDAR scan topic to detect how far the robot is from the wall
* Design your own algorithm or use a PID controller to move forward 1.5 meters parallel with the wall
* This assignment may require more parameter tuning to achieve consistent results
* Write a ROS node with publishers and subscribers for `cmd_vel` and `scan`

### References and Resources

* Use the PRRExamples library! 
* Learn PID <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller>

### Hints

* Learn about what a PID controller is
* Learn what odometry is and how it is represented in ROS
* Think about some other approaches to following the wall using the LiDAR scan
* The robot should be able to detect which side the wall is located
* Consider the multiple cases when the robot might need to turn
* Beware of invalid data from the lidar and look closely at how the data relates to the environment

### Deliverables

* ROS Package with
    * Commented Python source code file
    * README with specific instructions on how to run it
    * Correct package.xml CMakeLists.txt
* Video of your program running in gazebo or your lab at home
* Both submitted in Latte

title: "PA: Line Follower"
desc: "Robot looks for line on the floor and follows it"
---
## Introduction

* This assignment will introduce you to the basics of image processing and computer vision in robotics
* This will not require any machine learning but feel free to use it yourself

### Purpose

* Write a program to follow a distinct line on the ground using the robots camera 

### Expected preparation

* Learn how to use openCV in ROS
* Learn how to subscribe and use the camera image topics
* Understand the RGB representation of an image

### What I hope you will learn

* Work with and process camera RGB data
* How to use line detection, image filtering, and contour detection to identify already known features

### References and resources

* OpenCV <https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html>

* camera/image/compressed [CompressedImage](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/CompressedImage.html)

## Assignment

* Follow a distinct line on the ground/floor of your simulation/lab at home a set distance
* It is your task to keep the robot as close to the line as possible for as much of the length of the path as possible

### Deliverables

* Commented Python source code file named "FirstnameLastname_PA#"
* Video of your program running in gazebo or your lab at home 
* Both submitted in Latte

### Steps

* Subscribe to the compressed image topic
* Convert the callback message compressed image to a opencv compatible image
* Apply the image manipulation techniques to identify features of the line
* Use the feature information to control the robots movement to keep following the line

### Hints

* What information can you use about the location of your detected line to help control the robot?

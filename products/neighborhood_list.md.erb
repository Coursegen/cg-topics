title: Neighborhood Visual Directory
---
This might sound a bit simple but I believe it's a product that could get adoption and actually make money. The idea is simple. A group of people (a neighborhood, a dorm, a club) want to have a visual directory of members. Not "Facebook", not "LinkedIn". Something simpler and without any collaboration, social network or features. Here is a general idea of the features:

1. Tracking the members and basic information like names, emails, adddresses, phone numbers
1. No social network, email list, or collaboration features
1. Properties can be customized by the admins
1. Allow self service so a member can update their own information
1. Rich and complete handling of profile photos, such as cropping, sizing and so on.
1. Rich and complete display. A pdf, a web page, a photo
1. Import and export so the list can be used for other purposes, e.g. a mailing list, a contact list, excel

title: ActiveRecord Datatypes
desc: List of the datatypes used in Rails migrations and other places

## Built in standard data types

* ActiveRecord has these built in
* As an ORM, it promises that all the databases that it supports will have an analog to these
  * primary_key
  * string
  * text
  * integer
  * bigint
  * float
  * decimal
  * numeric
  * datetime
  * time
  * date
  * binary
  * boolean

* Certain databases, notably Postgres, has some very interesting additional types: [ActiveRecord Postgres](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_postgresql.html)
* To use them you need to go outside the built in ActiveRecord datatypes

title: Simple Design
desc: These are recommendations from famed hacker Corey Haines
---
* Tests Pass:
  * Yes, you have to learn how to write tests and make it part of your practice
  * Doesn't have to be test-driven design
* Expresses Intent:
  * Yes, naming matters a lot.
  * Often as or more important than documentation
* No Duplication (DRY)
  * In the simplest sense, no textual duplication of lines of code
  * More important: No duplication of concepts or knowledge
* Small
  * Partly YAGNI
  * But also: remove code paths, classes, test data, examples, abstractions that are no longer used.

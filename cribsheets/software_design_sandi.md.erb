### Sandi Metz on Good Design

* **Transparent:** The opposite of "clever". Is it easy to understand? Can a programmer anticipate the consquences of a change?
* **Reasonable:** How easy is it to make a simple change? Do you have to rewrite a whole class? Simple changes should be simple, and deeper changes should be possible.
* **Usable:** One sign of good design is if it shows itself to be usable in new ways for new purposes that were not necessarily apparent originally.
* **Exemplary:** Are you proud to show it off? Would you want someone to use your code as an example?

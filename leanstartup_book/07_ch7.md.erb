### Discussion Guide

* What was Chapter 7 about
	* actionable metrics
* What is a "split test"?
* Describe the Grokit story
	* What about Lazy registration? How did they test it?
  * They did a/b testing and found no difference in full registration
* What is the growth engine?
	* Metaphor. Given where you are now and where you want to be, what metrics will have to change and how will they change? For example, is it number of courses registered (Piazza), or the number of students affected? Is it the amount of revenue? You then need to figure out what will make those metrics change that way. You need to think of the states that customers go through and how many need to go from one state to the other. It's can also be known as the business model.
* Can you distinguish what a vanity metric is from an actionable metric with an example?
* What is Cohort Analysis
	* A way to focus on the impact of changes you make to specific subsets of customers or users. Otherwise you can't tell cause and effect.

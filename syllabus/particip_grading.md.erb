* Participation is a meaningful part of your final grade
* You are expected to attend every class from the beginning until the end. We will monitor attendance.
* Participation includes attendance, preparation, participation in class discussions, participation in break outs
* It also includes submissions to the 'participation blog'.
* Assignments which are graded for participation are marked by this icon: <%= partbadge %>**
* They allow you to show that you are participating in class, by reading and thinking about the work. 
* Your submissions are not marked for correctness but for participation. We require that you show a sincere *good faith* effort to respond to the question or prompt to receive a mark of 100. Otherwise you receive a mark of 0.

### Rough Outline

1. **Introduction:** Discuss the problem, for example discuss the major pain you are addressing, who has the pain, how is it a big problem? Consider an example or scenario

2. **Product:** Describe the product or service, for example using an Elevator pitch, or maybe a customer story or a demo or screenshots. Keep it simple and make really sure that the viewer really understands it. You would be surprised how often a viewer is left puzzled - "I don't really understand what this is..." Talk about your evidence of why this product is desired. Maybe use MVPs or data. And explain how you are solving the major pain, what jobs does it do for the customer, why you feel it is right.

3. **Business:** Demonstrate your understanding of the business side. Discuss the market, what segments, is it a one or two sided market, how do you plan to reach them. Mention the price and the key costs involved (tip: people costs often/usually dominate). Provide a super-simplified high level 3 year plan. Discuss your plans for growth. State how much money you want to raise and what you will do with it once you get it.

4. **Conclusion:** Reinforce the ONE take away. Mention what next steps might be and conclude with a thank-you

## Tips

* <%= link_to_topic :presentation_hints_general %>
* Emphasize important data with contrast/their own slides. 
* Highlight key metrics or results.
* For the video, use whatever tools you are comfortable with
* Better than Pito's home movies but not as good as CNN
* Try to make it not choppy, yet not rife with errors either.
* You don't need to be a Premiere Pro, but make it flow nicely.

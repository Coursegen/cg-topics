title: Introduction to ActiveRecord
---

### What is ActiveRecord?

* An [ORM Framework](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OrmHate.html)
* Reference: [Active Record Basics Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
* What are Models? Very important to understand this!
* Jobs that ActiveRecord does
  * Representations for models and their data
  * Representation of associations / relationships between models
  * Declarative validations of models
  * Abstraction over SQL, provides excellent optimization of SQL
  * Performance by caching, optimization

### Conventions

* Naming Conventions
  * Models
  * Tables
  * Records
  * Column names
* Schema conventions
  * Primary keys are always integers called "id"
  * Foreign keys are always called <other table>_id
  * Several other standard column names: created_at, updated_at, type, etc.

### Magic

* Sequence of events when database is opened
* Automatic creation of "attributes" based on column names

### Migrations

* Rails programmer utility
* Automates the updating of schemas as the application evolves
* Source of confusion often

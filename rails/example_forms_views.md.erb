title: Forms and Views
---
:h3 Tour of the sample code

* Reference containing all the code: [Forms View Demo Code](https://github.com/Cosi-166/form_view_demo)
* Feel free to look, but DON'T COPY/PASTE! I trust you otherwise why would I give you the repo?
* Take 10 minutes now to grab the code from github and look around

:h3 Models

* There are 4 models
  * Item (Has many comments)
  * Category (Has many items)
  * Comment (Belongs to a comment)

:h3 Routes

* <%= discussion "URLs, HTTP verbs and routes" %>

  * What's a good URL to see all items?
  * What's a good URL for search?
  * What's a good URL for seeing a list of comments? Think again
  * What's a good URL for creating a comment?
  * Let's look at routes.rb and take turns explaining each line

:h3 Let's look: Migrations

* Nothing special going on
* Notice exactly ONE per table (at this stage of the game)

:h3 Partials

* the _form.html.erb is a partial (view)
* the same body of the form is used in a new and update scenario
* Incorporate with `render 'partial'`

:h3 Seed data

* Put enough 'real looking' seed data so you can get a feel for the UI
* seeds.rb is a regular ruby program. Look at sample code.

:h3 Hacking the sample

* Get formdemo to run on your computer
* Update the new item form so it looks as pretty as the search form
* Update the new item form so it shows a popup of categories instead of a blank

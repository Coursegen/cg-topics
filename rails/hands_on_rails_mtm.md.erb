title: More practice with Rails DBs
---

### Objective

The objective of this lab is to create a simple Rails application with two models which have a many-to-many relationship.
For example, `Students` may have many `Classes` and `Classes` may have many `Students`.

**You should come up with your own models for this exercise!**

Here is what you should do at a high level:

1. Create a new Rails application with models and basic page views using the `rails generate scaffold` command.
2. Use Faker to populate your database. You can use the `sample` method to create random relationships between models.
3. Push your application to Heroku!

### Create rails app

<%= source_begin "language-ruby" %>
rails new many_to_many --database=postgresql
cd many_to_many
bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux --add-platform ruby
<%= source_end %>

### Gemfile

<%= source_begin "language-ruby" %>
gem 'pry-byebug'
gem 'better_errors'
gem 'awesome_print'
gem 'faker'
gem 'hirb'
<%= source_end %>

### Commands relating to seeding
<%= source_begin "language-ruby" %>
rails db:create  # creates the database for the current env
rails db:migrate # Run latest migrations
rails db:seed    # (only) runs the db/seed.rb file
rails db:setup   # runs db:schema:load, db:seed
<%= source_end %>

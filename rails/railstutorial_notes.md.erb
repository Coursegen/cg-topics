## Access to the tutorial

* Apply for a scholarship with your @brandeis.edu account, with the comment: "I am a student in Pito Salas' software engineering course at Brandeis University." and they should give you access quickly.

## Versions
* Ruby 2.7.2
* Rails 6.1.1

## Special rules for this course

* Don't use Cloud9, Eclipse or Idea: The book suggests using the Cloud9 environment. I have not used it so I cannot vouch for it. I know that when you get to your project you will not be using it. You should use the command line.
* I recommend Visual Studio Code, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com). You can also use Atom or Sublime as your text editor: There are other ones, particularly on Windows. Whatever you use, it needs to be simple text editor that reads and writes simple "ascii" files. I recommend Atom.
* Don't use **RVM**. Instead use **Rbenv**.
* Use Bootstrap version 4

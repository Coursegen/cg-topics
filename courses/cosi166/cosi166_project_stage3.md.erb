title: "Term Project Stage 3: Core"
---
:h2 Goals

1. Get to the point your project starts coming to life with real screens and real functionality
1. Get to the point where you can do an elementary preliminary demo

:h2 What you will learn

1. How to prioritize work
1. Being realistic about what you can get done in a certain time window
1. Ability to cut a feature you love because you will otherwise run out of time

## Steps

1. Prepare a paper prototype of the key screens of your 1.0, plus UX flows. By doing this before trying to implement a lot of code in ruby you give yourself freedom to change things around based on your own testing as well as maybe showing it to others.
1. Elaborate the schema for your application. Remember, if you don't know your schema, you don't know your application! Still remember YAGNI. Don't get too far ahead of yourself in terms of features that you may never get to!
1. Work out your URL scheme and build the routes. This will follow reasonably directly from your schema and your paper prototype.
1. Identify and describe your key views and models. Use rails generators to generate scaffolding for your key models and views. At this point you should be getting close to something working a little bit. As soon as you start adding code to your controllers, models and views, it will get more difficult to run scaffold generation. But feel free to use a generated scaffold as sample code to remember the standard idioms
1. Database up and running (focus on core views)

1. Implement many of your forms and views. STRONGLY ADVISE agains AJAX at this point!

1. User accounts: registration, login, logout, administration

1. Identify what gems you need and learn them

1. Implement initial set of authentication and authorization views

1. Basic unit tests of models and one or two integration tests

1. Deployed to Codeship and Heroku

1. Use RailsAdmin to quickly get an admin UI to all your data.

1. Add one or two interesting gems to your application to create a cool feature outside of basic CRUD functionality.

1. Prepare for a mid-semester check-in with Pito and your TA partner.

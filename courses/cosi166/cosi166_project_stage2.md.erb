## Goal

1.

## What you will learn

1. How to analyze an application and figure out the needed tables

1. How to create models and controllers

1.

## Steps

1. Decide the attributes (or properties or columns) are of the first few models. Figure out what the schema will be and how the associations run. Just think in terms of the schema or structure and decide as a team. Keep it simple at this point with no more than 5 (but more likely 3) tables.

1. Create stories in Trello for each table and try to have more than one teammate be involved in actually building the code.

1. Create your models  using scaffolding using `rails generate`. For this you will be using one or more `rails generate resource` commands. This should come right out of the Rails Tutorial you've been reading.

1. Create Seed data, which means data which is not from real users but used to "seed" the database. There are many reasons for Seed data: to allow you to test, to allow you to see your UI better, and sometimes  because there are some bits of data that are built into the system. Seed data will be stored in the database just like live data and Rails provides you nice tools more managing and working with seed data. There is a very neat package to create fun fake names, addresses and all kinds of other information. It's very popular and is called [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker). This is a pretty reasonable guide (I looked around) to get you started: [Seeding a database using the Rails command line](https://davidmles.com/seeding-database-rails/)

1. Now get the server running on each individual students' computer. Don't skip this step, do it on your own computer too! Get it running on your personal computers, checked into Github. Make sure that all students have the latest code from GitHub on your computers. Don't let the code get skewed.

1. Now actually deploy your code so far into the cloud by deploying it on  Heroku (see <%= link_to_topic :hands_on_heroku %> )

1.Work as a team on a prioritized story list for your release 1.0. Add to Trello. This is expected to be maintained as the project continues.

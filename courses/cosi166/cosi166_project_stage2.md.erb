## What you will learn

## Steps

1. Decide the attributes (or properties or columns)are of the first few models. Figure out what the schema will be and how the associations run. Create stories in Trello and build the migrations and the models and views.
1. Create it using scaffolding. For this you will be using one or more `rails generate resource` commands. This should come right out of the Rails Tutorial you've been reading.
1. This means data which is not from real users but used to "seed" the database. There are many reasons for Seed data: to allow you to test, to allow you to see your UI better, and sometimes  because there are some bits of data that are built into the system. Seed data will be stored in the database just like live data and Rails provides you nice tools more managing and working with seed data. There is a very neat package to create fun fake names, addresses and all kinds of other information. It's very popular and is called [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker). This is a pretty reasonable guide (I looked around) to get you started: [Seeding a database using the Rails command line](https://davidmles.com/seeding-database-rails/)
1. Get it running on your personal computers, checked into Github.
1. Get it deployed in the cloud on Heroku (see <%= link_to_topic :hands_on_heroku %> )
1. Prioritized story list for your release 1.0. Add to trello. This is expected to be maintaiend as the project continues.

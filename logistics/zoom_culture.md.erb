### Classroom and Zoom Culture

* Things are different. New challenges.
* Eight students are "on the panel"
    * I will be addressing them more
    * I will be expecting them to be better prepared
    * I will expect them to engage in discussion
    * Rest of the class can post questions through Chat
* Zoom Cameras
    * If you are participating you need to be on zoom and have the camera on
    * Exceptions are allowed with prior permission from me
* Identity
    * Use your real name not a fake, made up, funny or other name (Bojack for example)
    * I will sometimes ask you to change your background color
    * Teams will have a separate color

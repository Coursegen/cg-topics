### Homeworks

* Are due at the beginning of the relevant week
* Will be due on Monday night for that week
* Will have points deducted for lateness and format
    * 3 day automatic grace period (with 10 points off)
    * For written homework, you must submit a pdf with your name and the homework number at the top of the page, otherwise another 10 points off.

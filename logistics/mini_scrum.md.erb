## MiniScrum - Our approach

* Agile methodologies are designed for ongoing projects with dedicated teams
* Our situation:
  * 13 week course
  * Learning experience
  * Only one of many commitments
* Hybrid / subset of Scrum and Kanban

### Our approach
* 1 week sprints
* Weekly written project status submission (see <%= link_to_topic :weekly_progress_updates %>)
* Trello for Stories

### Weekly Meeting
* Schedule a mandatory weekly meeting with all teammates
* Same time, same place
* Establish how you will communicate (messenger, slack, whatever)
* Prepare and submit your <%= link_to_topic :weekly_progress_updates %>

### Story
* A brief (1-3 sentence) summary of something that has to be done
* Level of detail corresponds to what would be needed to complete the story.
* All stories start off in the backlog
* Every "idea" or piece of work should be a story on Trello
* Stories are re-prioritized on a continuing basis

### Trello
* Tool for tracking stories
* Get one account for each team
* Share it with Professor and TAs
* Start with these lanes:
    * Backlog
    * In progress
    * Completed
    * Abandoned

### Sprints

* Use a weekly sprint corresponding to your weekly meeting
* At the start of the spring, reprioritize
* Some number of stories from the top of the backlog are planned for the coming week.
* Associate specific students which stories to be done this week
* Whenever new ideas come up, during brainstorming or anything else, add them to the backlog.

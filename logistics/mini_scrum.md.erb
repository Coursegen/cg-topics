  1. Only one of many commitments
* Hybrid / subset of Scrum and Kanban
* Our approach
  1. 1 week sprints
  1. Weekly written project status submission
  1. Trello for Stories

### Sprints

* Use a weekly sprint corresponding to your weekly meeting
* At the start of the spring, reprioritize
* Some number of stories from the top of the backlog are planned for the coming week.
* Associate specific students which stories to be done this week
* Whenever new ideas come up, during brainstorming or anything else, add them to the backlog.

#### Weekly Meeting

  1. Schedule a mandatory weekly meeting with all teammates
  1. Same time, same place
  1. Establish how you will communicate (messenger, slack, whatever)
  1. Prepare and submit your <%= link_to_topic :weekly_progress_updates %>

#### Story

* A brief (1-3 sentence) summary of something that has to be done
* Level of detail corresponds to what would be needed to complete the story.
* All stories start off in the backlog
* Every "idea" or piece of work should be a story on Trello
* Stories are re-prioritized on a continuing basis

#### Trello

* Tool for tracking stories
* Get one account for each team
* Share it with Professor and TAs
* Start with these lanes:
  1. Backlog
  1. In progress
  1. Completed
  1. Abandoned

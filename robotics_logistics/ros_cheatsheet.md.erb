## General tips

* When in shell use the tab-key for command completion
* The ROS shell utilities all will list options, package names, etc with a single or double tab
* The notation below is that a line that starts with a `$` dollar sign is meant to be typed into the shell - without the dollar sign

## ROS Shell utilities

* `roscore`: Start the ROS Core program
* `rostopic`: Work with topics
  * `rostopic list`: list all ros topics that roscore knows about
  * `rostopic echo`: print out any topics that are published
  * `rostopic info`: ask ros what it knows about a certain topic
* `rqt_graph` - display topics and subscriptions in a nice graphical format
* `roslaunch` - tool to launch collections of ROS nodes in one command. Requires a 'package launch file'
* `rosversion -d` - what ros version is installed?

## FAQ

* **roscore:** You must have `roscore` running before you try to run any ros-related program
* **Execution**: In order to execute a program/script on Linux, you must `chmod +x filename.py`
* **shebang:** Also include the 'shebang': #!/usr/bin/env python
* `apt` family of commands, see: https://itsfoss.com/apt-command-guide/

:h2 (Pito's) Rules of thumb for good User Experience

:slide_title 1. Pay attention to AFFORDANCES

* I want to make you become aware of affordances all around you
* Visual (or other clues) that something can be pushed, pulled, dragged, clicked, etc.
* Without them user is lost
* [How a UI problem caused a maritime accident](https://arstechnica.co.uk/information-technology/2017/11/uss-mccain-collision-ultimately-caused-by-ui-confusion/)

:slide_title 2. Know the answer to the question: WHO IS MY USER?

* "Personas". Note, often there is more than one.
* Build on what users likely have seen before
* Platform consistency (iPhone, Android ... but then compare with Flash. Is that a platform? How about web?)
* Conventions: back, home, undo, cut, paste, file menu, etc.

:slide_title 3. Guide the USERS' CONCEPTUAL MODEL (sometimes called the user metaphor)

* Some links:
  1. This [article](http://sixrevisions.com/user-interface/5-reasons-why-metaphors-can-improve-the-user-experience/) talks about one kind of metaphor. I mean something broader.
  1. This [article](http://blog.usabilla.com/how-metaphors-can-improve-your-user-experience/) has some more relevant examples.
  1. This [article](http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/design/user-interface-metaphor-links/) has some interesting examples of misunderstood and obsolete metaphors
* What this application or feature is about - that sets expectations?
* What the USER (see above) is 'expecting' right now?  What is she 'reaching for' right now?
* Remember the importance of WORDS that match this metaphor and user expectations
* Metaphors can become dated and inappropriate (file save icon in MS Word is what?) Any examples?

:slide_title 4. PROXIMITY Implies RELATIONSHIP

* Put things that relate to each other near each other and vice versa
* Pay attention to the Visual Hierarchy
* Denote hierarchy/nesting of elements: posts->comments, projects->tasks, playlists->tracks, etc.
* Use size (and type choice) consistently to communicate importance/role
* Alignment and balance are important for aesthetics

:slide_title 5. Don't Make Them Think! [a book by Steve Krug](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515)

* Don't user spend ANY mental energy on questions like...
* Where am I?
* Where should I begin?
* Where did they put it?
* What are the most important things on this screen?
* Think about DISCOVERABILITY

:slide_title 6. Deal with COMPLEXITY

* "Simple things should be simple to do, complex things should be possible"
* Principle of progressive disclosure.
* What controls are only available at the back panel of the device, under a little door?
* We all know that users don't read manuals, right?

## Plan for today

* This lab will be a guided independent programming session. Please do the following during lab while we are around to help everyone solve their problems.
* This is brand new so we don't know yet how much time it will take
* When you complete each section, ask a TA to come over so you can discuss what you achieved 

## Environment

* Review the <%= link_to_topic :cosi166b_required_prep %>
* Demonstrate that you are using the right versions:

<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>
$ rbenv --version

$ ruby --version

$ rails --version

<%= source_end %>

## Git and GitHub

* Install the git application if it's not already installed on your computer

  * We're really lucky to have Brittany Greenfield with us to speak about how she came up with the ideas and product that led to Wabbi.
  * Brittany is a Duke undergrad and MIT Sloan MBA. She has spent her career identifying new market opportunities, and building and executing the strategies to bring them to life at companies including OpenAir, NetSuite, Kronos, Cisco, and Cybereason.
  * Outside of Wabbi, Brittany is active in her community serving on the MassTLC Board of Directors, Vilna Shul Board of Directors, and Chair of the Duke Young Alumni Development Committee and BBS Chair of the Boston Ballet Young Partners. And when not at her computer, you can find her speeding down a ski piste, yelling at a golf ball, or studying for her Level 1 Sommelier exam.

### PID Control

* PID stands for "proportional", "integrated", "derivitive"
* It is used to make a feedback loop stable
<%= discussion_box "Consider the feedback loop when following a wall"%>
* PID is a well known technique for smoothing out control, to avoid oscilation. 
* Applying PID control to a feedback algoritm will make it more robust and perform more consistently. 
* PID control is a smoothing function which helps you better follow a wall without too much fluctuation.
* It will make the robot turn at a higher speed when you are too away from the designated route (too far or too close to the wall), and turn at a slower speed when you are close to it.

Here are some great links. You will be amazed at how well this works.

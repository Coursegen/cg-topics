### Agile in the real world

* Other methodologies: waterfall. "BDUF".

### General techniques

* **Small teams**: Small, empowered, cross functional teams (scrum teams)
* **Measure**: Don't estimate -- measure velocity
* **Iterations/Sprints**: Work in fixed units of time (time-boxing)
* **Stories**: Describe what is to be built in small bite-size pieces
* **Prioritization:** Constant reprioritization (sprint planning meeting)
* **Daily Standup meetings**: Practice radical transparency and no-blame culture. See [Daily Scrum Meeting](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/daily-scrum)

:slide_title How it works with Rails

* ERBs are used primarily in views (also known as view templates in rails)
* Rails has numerous "helper" methods that work very nicely with erb
* In "routes.rb": resource or get or path or other command "automatically" defines one or more helpers.
* In the example below, "sessions_path" was generated by the `resources :sessions` line in routes.rb
* **Reference:** [Rails Form Helpers](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html) 

:slide_title Example

:source_begin :ruby

  <%% form_for(:sessions, url: sessions_path) do |f|  %>
      &lt;div>
        email: <%%= f.text_field :email %>
      &lt;/div>
      &lt;div>
        password: <%%= f.password_field :password %>
      &lt;/div>
      <%%= f.submit "Sign in" %>
  <%% end %>

:source_end

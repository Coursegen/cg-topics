## A Brandeis Projects Listing

One of your deliverables is a text file describing your project. It is essential that you follow the format precisely. This is an easy deliverable to ace, and yet year after year people overlook it, do it at the last minute, and it comes out wrong.

### Specification. Follow this carefully or points are deducted.

1. A simple text file. Not Word, PDF, Latex, or rtf. Just text! Name is <yourproject>.txt**
1. The blurb is a paragraph of explanatory text
1. All fields are in the form `title: body`
1. Not all fields apply to all courses
1. Make sure that the image: is a url to an image, not to an imgur page or other general web page. Just an image, .png or .jpeg
1. We check each URL and if it doesn't work, points are deducted.

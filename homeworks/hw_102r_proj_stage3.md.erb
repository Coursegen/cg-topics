title: Term Project Final Report
---
### Purpose

During the final 3 weeks we will focus on the business issues for your product. In particular I hope that you will learn the following keys:

1. How to create a basic financial model for your business
1. Understanding the financing and different financing approaches
1. The fundamental metrics of runway, burn rate, break even, cash break even
1. Approaches to pricing and how to think clearly about the tradeoffs

### Specific Knowledge

1. You will know how to lay out a competitive matrix
1. You will learn how to use Excel and Google Sheets for basic financial analysis

### Tasks

It is important to remember that what you did for Stage 1 and Stage 2 likely has evolved and will keep on evolving. For example, a new pricing idea might have come to light. Or you might have had a major pivot. This is all common. So, when you use information from earlier in the course, e.g. Stages 1 and 2, for your final deliverable it is reasonable and likely that you will make updates.

* You will revise your stage Two report report with specific updates to the existing sections and additional sections as well. The report will be assessed as a whole. This is the last stage and so you will be submitting a finalized report. It should be 10-15 pages.

* The report should be written at the level of quality of any academic report or a professional business report. It should be written professional english, have an introduction and a conclusion. Here is the new outline:

**Competition**: What is out there that attempts to solve the same (or similar) problem for the same (or similar) users? How will you be different from your competition? You need to have an awareness of what else is out there, and often it is useful to think in terms of a 'feature grid'

**Pricing**: We've talked a lot about pricing this month. You should be testing pricing ideas, AS HYPOTHESES in your MVPs. And you should do the simple spreadsheet modeling to show that you have an understanding of the impact of your pricing on the overall valuation of your business. What approach to capturing revenue is right for your product? Who are the users vs. the customers? Is this a two sided market? Who pays? Who gets paid?

**Growth**: What is your engine of growth? What techniques will likely work to achieve growth and make your business sustainable? Remember that as an entrepreneur you are only successful when your impact on the world increases from your starting point. If your project is about delivering blankets to homeless in Boston, how do you now think about having the same impact in Waltham? Or Providence? Or in 100 cities around the USA? If your project is a two sided marketplace in one geography, for one segment, or for one type of service, then how do you grow the initial market places, or how to you add geographies or segments or services?

**Costs**: Where are the costs in your product? Consider your startup phase and your growth phase. Consider material, service, and especially people costs. Also think about the intimate connection of your costs with your growth models.

### Deliverable

* You will revise your stage two report report with specific updates to the existing sections and additional sections as well. The report will be assessed as a whole.

* The report should be written at the level of quality of any academic report. It should be written professional english, have an introduction and a conclusion. It does not need a title page. Here is the new outline:

1. Introduction **(updated)**
1. Vision. (**pre-existing**) Based on your brainstorming what is a succinct explanation of the vision for your product or business? You will be stating this again in Phase 2 and Phase 3, and it likely will change. **(updated)**
1. Elevator Pitch **(new)**. You should have a viable Elevator pitch by this stage. Make sure you practice it and could give it to "the president" if you happened to run into her in an elevator. You might have more than one elevator pitch if, for example, it is aimed at two different audiences. Try it on some appropriate people and make note of their reaction and refine the pitch as required. Include the text of the pitch in your report.
1. Mockup or other product visuals **(updated)** This can be a Paper Prototype, a non-working model, a working model, a video, a rendering of the product. Include some explanation or documentation of how you used this in your testing. (<%= link_to_topic :ideas_for_visuals %>)
1. Hypotheses (**updated**) Hypotheses should be prioritized and classified and clearly described. They should be consistent with the overall product vision.
1. Result of testing. **(updated)** Many of these should be done virtually out of the building, meaning, with outside people who were not previously known to you.  at least 5 hypotheses with real out of the building experiments, of various kinds, using a variety of MVPs. Write them up and comment on the process and how it worked, what hypothesis was, and whether it was proven.
1. Markets and Customers **(updated)**. List of customer categories or types, and an explanation of their role in your startup. Be specific about why each customer type makes sense for your business.
1. Value Prop **(updated)**. Your completed Value Proposition Canvas, and your conclusions about your product's value to certain customers, as well as a sense of the channels you can use to reach them.
1. Financial model and pricing **(new)** Provide a basic financial model and/or forecast. Remember to work out the costs for delivering your product or service, its relationship to the number of customers. It's reasonable to consider several "stages" where the assumptions change. Generally you can show 3 years in months. Of course we understand that this is just a common-sense forecast that is well reasoned but certainly will depend on guesses on key unknowns. Also discuss your current, and hopefully validated ideas for pricing. Pricing can often evolve once it is first presented to potential customers. Demonstrate (and justify) the effect of your pricing model on your financial model.
1. Competition **(new)** What or who are the major competitors. How do they compare with your product or business? Create a competitive matrix to show how your product compares
1. Reflection and conclusion. What was the process like to get to where you are? How happy are you with the results? What are the one or two biggest learnings from the course. Would it make business sense for someone (not necessarily you) continue developing this business in the future?  **(updated)**

*Appendix (does not count towards page count)*
1. Meeting Notes **(updated)**. List of dates and times and attending student of each team meeting with a 1 sentence summary of results.

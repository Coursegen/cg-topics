:h3 Purpose

:h3 Steps

1. Create a single GitHub repo in the [campusrover organization](https://github.com/campusrover)
1. Create a single Trello board for your project with four columns: backlog, in progress, completed, abandoned
1. Have detailed discussions with your teammate(s) to make sure that all are in alignment on your expected deliverables 
1. Decide on a name for your project
1. Brainstorm the pieces of work that have to happen and add them to your trello under backlog
1. Brainstorm final feature set - both a base set of goals and an additional set of "stretch" goals. 
1. Be realistic about what you think you will be able to achieve
1. Indicate what hardware and/or lab access you are depending on

:h3 What to include

* Project name and names of the partners
* High level description
* Details about what you think the hardest parts are
* What are the key components/modules/packages of the final project
* Base feature set goals -- when it is `done` - what will it `do`? 
* Stretch goals - if things go faster than expected, what will we do beyond the base feature set?
* Deliverables for the term project are:
  1. Complete, high quality source code
  1. Video demonstration
  1. Project report in a comprehensive readme.md
  1. 2 Contributions to Lab Notebook
* How you would like me to assess it
  * A set of factors that you think are important
  * And/or what aspects of it you think will most demonstrate what you've learned or can do
* Note that both partners will get the same score for the final deliverable

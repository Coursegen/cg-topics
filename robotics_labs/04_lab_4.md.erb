## Plan for today

* This lab will be a guided team programming session.
* Work on it with your Teammate
* You can use a breakout room for privacy
* Invite one of us over to help if needed
* Call us in when you are done

## Mini-PA: Filter Scan

1. Write a node that subscribes to /scan and publishes a new topic /lidar
1. /lidar's message is a custom message called "Lidar.msg"
1. The data from /scan is cleaned and filtered mapped based on parameters
1. And published as /Lidar
1. Parameter is: NUM_SLICES: how many slices you want in the result
1. Lidar.msg will contain an array NUM_SLICES with that many slices
1. And the filtered and cleaned "average" distance in the direction of the slice
1. Tricky: It would be nice if Slice 0 always is "forward" 
1. Figure out a way to visualize the result

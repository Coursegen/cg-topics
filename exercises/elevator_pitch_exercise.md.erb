## Elevator Pitch Exercise

### Background

* We are going to try our hand at designing an elevator pitch for a product or service that you know well. You can also refer to <%= link_to_topic :elevator_pitch %>
* Think about who the pitch is to, because the way the pitch goes is different depending on the audience
* In general the elevator pitch should be short, and it has a goal of persuading a particular audience that they should be interested in your product and want to learn more about it
* **Remember** This is not an ad on radio or tv, it's a pitch between you and a person you are trying to influece.

### Activities

* Each team will meet in a breakout room. Based on your team number, you are assigned a product (see below.) 
* Your goal is to come up with the best elevator pitch for one of these products would be. 
* Remember to pay attention to the specified audience, as your pitch has to be tailored and appropriate to that audience.
* While you don't want a fixed script you do want to make sure you write down all the key points or phrases to make sure you don't leave anything out.

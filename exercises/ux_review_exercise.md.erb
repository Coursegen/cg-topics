## User Experience Site Review

### Purpose: 

* Practicing awareness of basic user interface and design best practices
* Practicing ability to articulate exactly what's wrong with a design (because until you can articulate it you can't fix it)
* Recall and application of the rules of thumbs

### What I hope you learn

* By listening to the critiques of others you will gain insights in how to recognize and how to articulate these kinds of issues
* By thinking about it to prepare you will reinforce your own understanding of the best practices
* By seeing several different writer's conception of the best practices, you will learn that there is no one correct authority

### Process 

* We will split into 11 random breakout rooms
* Each room pick the example that matches your room number.
* Check it out and think about usability and the usability principles
* Make notes about what's good and/or bad about each one? 
* And, specifically refer to one of the principles we have discussed.
* Just saying "its hard to use", "its confusing" or "it's ugly" is not enough
* Each comment should be specific about a principle and you suggest a specific action to improve it
* Prepare be called on as a team to demo the site and explain what you found
* Post your notes to the [participation blog](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=398089)

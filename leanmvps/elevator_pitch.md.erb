## What is an Elevator Pitch?

* A metaphor for a brief, engaging description of your product or service
* Literally what you would say if you ran into the President in an elevator
* Or at a conference when networking

### Tips for elevator pitches

* You should have it at the tip of your tongue so when you run into the president you can answer the question: "So, what's your business do?" in a clear, interesting, catchy, provocative manner.
* Purpose of an elevator pitch is to sell you and your idea
* To get the listener to say, "hmm, let's sit down so you can tell me more."
* An elevator pitch is meant to be spoken or read to a potential investor or board member
* Put yourself in the listeners shoes, really! Imagine that they say, "So What?" in response to each of your lines
* If there's a very obvious objection, respond to it right away.
* Hook them with the first words out of your mouth.

### What to say

* Brief: About 30 seconds
* Persuasive: Get listener to say "tell me more!"
* Practice: So you're always ready
* Audience: Responsive to your audience: is it a colleague, a possible job opportunity, are you trying to recruit someone?
* Listener context: Don't make assumptions about the listened
* Jargon: Avoid it
* Proof points: If you have them

### Example

* Here's an example elevator pitch. I am the CEO of PARKO and looking for investors. I meet a big-time venture capitalist in an elevator. Here's my pitch. Please critique it:

* *We know that finding a parking space often is really hard. You waste gas and time searching; then you pay through the nose and caused pollution and congestion. And on the other side, office buildings, banks, and other businesses often have lots that are idle in the evening and weekend.*

* *We've created PARKO, a two sided marketplace to match the need with the supply. It's a pretty simple idea: you can reserve parking in a private property; they in turn can monetize their idle resources. Less waste, use idle resources, make money and save money. We've proven product market fit and are now looking for growth investments.*

### Good examples of really short pitches (a matter of opinion)

* *“I work on nanotechnology to deliver medical therapies to targeted cells to improve treatment of many terrible diseases/”*
* *“We are using the manufacturing techniques of the computer industry to make better vaccines”*

### Bad Examples (a matter of opinion)

* *“Our company's core competency is building synergy between top consumer brands and their customers. We help these companies to up-sell and cross-sell their products while delighting their customers with new products.”*

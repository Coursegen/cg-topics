## Chess-Bot - Manipulation

* Robot Manipulators come in many shapes and sizes
* Well known robot manipulators from videos of car factories
* They are often "blind"

### Abstract definitions

* A collection of joins held together by links
* Revolute Joints (also rotary or pin joints)
* Prismatic (also linear joints)
* Links are stiff parts connecting joints together. ("bones")

### Kinematic Chains

* A set of links and joints together form a *kinematic chain*
* If one end is attached to something fixed (like the floor) it is "grounded"
* The other end will usually have some kind of gripper, sensor, or effector
* This system can be complex and can be analyzed mathematically

### Coordinate Frames

* Ground based mobile robots have two important coordinate frames: the map and robot frames.
* Robot arms have many more coordinate systems.
* The links are fixed and of known length
* The joints are all in a known position represented by one or more angles
* Joint space and task space

### Forward Kinematics

* If you set all the joint angles a certain way, where will the end be in space?
* This has a single solution and is tractable

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Reverse Kinematics

* If you want the end to be in a certain location, what should the joint angles be?
* This might have zero (out of reach), or more solutions

## Chess-Bot - Manipulation

* Robot Manipulators come in many shapes and sizes
* Well known robot manipulators from videos of car factories
* They are often "blind"

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Abstract definitions

* A collection of joins held together by links
* Revolute Joints (also rotary or pin joints)
* Prismatic (also linear joints)
* Links are stiff parts connecting joints together. ("bones")

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Kinematic Chains

* A set of links and joints together form a *kinematic chain*
* If one end is attached to something fixed (like the floor) it is "grounded"
* The other end will usually have some kind of gripper, sensor, or effector
* This system can be complex and can be analyzed mathematically

### Coordinate Frames

* Ground based mobile robots have two important coordinate frames: the map and robot frames.
* Robot arms have many more coordinate systems.
* The links are fixed and of known length
* The joints are all in a known position represented by one or more angles
* Joint space and task space

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Forward Kinematics

* If you set all the joint angles a certain way, where will the end be in space?
* This has a single solution and is tractable

### Reverse Kinematics

* If you want the end to be in a certain location, what should the joint angles be?
* This might have zero (out of reach), or more solutions

## Coding

### Install various needed ros packages

<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>
sudo apt-update
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-ros-control ros-melodic-gazebo-ros-control ros-melodic-joint-state-controller ros-melodic-effort-controllers ros-melodic-joint-trajectory-controller ros-melodic-moveit* ros-melodic-octomap* ros-melodic-object-recognition-*
<%= source_end %>

### Now install R2 stuff

<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>
$ cs # cd to catkin_ws/src
$ mkdir -p chessbot/src
$ cd chessbot/src
$ git clone -b melodic https://github.com/plskeggs/nasa_r2_simulator.git
$ git clone -b melodic https://github.com/plskeggs/nasa_r2_common.git
$ cw # cd to catkin_ws
$ cm # catkin_make
$ roslaunch r2_gazebo r2_gazebo.launch
<%= source_end %>

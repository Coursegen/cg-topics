## Introduction
* A distributed "operating system"
* A process coordinator and an inter-process communications model
* Different parts (nodes) can run on different computers
* They all need to be connected by a LAN via TCP/IP

## The ROS Graph

### Nodes
* Fundamental concept in ROS
* ROS runs a number of collaborating processes called "nodes"
* Think of it as a program or a process which forms part of a system
* A real robot will have dozens to hundreds of nodes
* You can write nodes in Python (we will do) or C++
* Nodes talk top each other by publishing and subscribing to messages
* Everything starts with the 'traffic-cop' `roscore`
* Once `roscore` runs, additional nodes can run
* Each node is essentially a serpate program, maybe even a single file
* Can be written in Python or C++
* We will use Python mostly

#### Odometry
* Topics have a name and a message type
* Twist message type is very very common.
  * Expresses a velocity in linear and angular aspects
  * Note our robot can only move forward and backward (x axis)
  * And it can only rotate around (z axis)
  * Twist doesn't say anything about where the robot (thinks it) is
  * "cmd_vel" is the topic to *directly* command the base (people often refer to the robot as a whole as the base) to move. The message type for cmd_vel is Twist
* Odometry
  * The Robot's "belief" of where it is, and what it is doing.
  * Based on sensors in the base, including possibly the motors, a gps, a magnetometer etc.
  * Odometry is published as topic /odom and the message definition is called nav_msgs/Odometry
* nav_msgs/Odometry
  * Header - standard header
  * pose - where does the robot thinks that it is (including Covariance - how sure is it?)
  * twist - how does it think it is moving (also with a covariance)

## ROSCORE
* Master coordinator of all the nodes
* It is run once at a known ip address or domain name
* Any other node will make contact with it to announce itself
* When one node talks to another, roscore helps them find each other and then steps out of the way.

### Communication model
* Message based
* Most important model is "publish/subscribe"
* publish a **topic**, subscribe to a **topic**
* Many to many (Nodes can publish to many topics and subscribe to many topics)
* Topics have a name (e.g. /cmd_vel)
* Topics have an associated message

## catkin, Workspaces, and ROS Packages

### catkin
* catkin is the ROS build system
* It's quite complicated and related to CMAKE
* Treat it like a black box

### Workspaces
* A subdirectory in which you will be doing your ROS work
* You need only one and it will be called catkin_ws/
* You should already have it on your linux install, but here's how you would create it otherwise:

<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cs
$ catkin_init_workspace
<%= source_end %>

* From time to time you have to build things, called "doing a build or make"
* Use the alias `cm`

#### .bashrc
* A "hidden" file in your home directory
* Contains a series of shell commands that are executed each time you start a shell
* It is populated with lots of useful stuff by the installation of ROS
* Any commands you want run each time will be placed there
* note: `source ~/.bashrc` command reads the file and exectutes it as if you typed it into bash
* Key environment variables have to be defined in .bashrc

<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
$ export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost
$ export TB3_MODEL=burger
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
<%= source_end %>

### ROS Packages
* A complete "application" or "tool"
* Analogous to a gem in ruby, or a library in Java
* Has a standardized layout:

<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>$ cs
$ catkin_create_pkg my_new_package rospy
<%= source_end %>

* Contents of a package directory
  * `package.xml` # describes all the things that are in the package
  * `CMakeLists.txt` # describes how to "build" 
  * `./messages` # descriptors of the messages
  * `./scripts` # contains all the python source files
  * `./launch` # contains all the .launch files

#### Synchronizing clocks
* It is important that all computers that are in the ROS system (probably three - robot, roscore1 and your computer) have the same time. Note timeset is a bash function that is defined our class utilities directory, ./rosutils. which you should be calling from .bashrc (see above)

<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>$ cs
$ settime
<%= source_end %>

#### Python programs
* Most of your python code will implement nodes
* You should put them into the ./scripts directory
* Name them *.py and give them execution file property: `chmod +x myfile.py`

## rosrun
<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>$ cs
$ rosrun package program.py     # run a certain program from a certain package
$ rqt_graph                     # display nodes and topics graphically
$ roscd package                 # change directories to directory containing that package
$ roslaunch package file.launch # "execute" that launch file
<%= source_end %>

## Names, Namespaces and Remapping
* Everything in the ros world has a name that looks like a file path
* For example: `/cmd_vel` is a topic name
* To allow flexibility,m you can remap a name to another name on the command line, e.g.

<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>$ cs
$ ./image_view image:=right/image
<%= source_end %>

## roslaunch
* Many real ROS applications have multiple nodes
* To save time having to start each one separately
* (And for many other reasons)
* A .launch file contains instructios on what to launch and in what order

<%= source_begin "language-xml" %>
&lt;launch&gt;
    &lt;node name="talker" pkg="rospy_tutorials" type="talker.py" output="screen" /&gt;
    &lt;node name="listener" pkg="rospy_tutorials" type="listener.py" output="screen" /&gt;
&lt;/launch&gt;
<%= source_end %>

## tf: Coordinate Transforms
* See [TF Tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/TF)
* Coordinate system
* There will/can be many
* Some of the components might move (an arm for example)
* tf system periodically broadcasts the current relationship between coordinate systems
* Quaternions

### Poses, Positions, and Orientations
* Handy and very common term to mean: 3d position and 3d orientation of something
* (Not velocity, just the position)
* Usually the transform between the robot coordinate frame and the maps coordinate frame

### tf
* Frames: Essential and complicated concept
* Find the change in position and orientation between two coordinate frames
* High level: a way to compute relative coordinate systems
* `tf` is a central package of ROS which computes transformations for Frames
* If I know a position relative to the room, what is that position relative to the robot?

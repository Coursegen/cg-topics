## PRR Chapter 6: Robots and Simulators

### Building blocks
* Robots are made up of many subsystems
* Subsystems are 'represented' in the software
* Actuation (e.g. wheels)
* Sensing (e.g. cameras)
* Computing (e.g. brains)

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Actuation
* Wheels - Differential Drive
  * Differential drive: Turtlebot3
  * Turning by different speed on two or more wheels
  * Sometimes there is a caster
  * Can only move forward and backward.
  * Not up and down or (directly) sideways
  * With more than 2 wheels, or a track - skid teering
  * Cars have "ackerman" steering (4 wheels, 2 that can steer)
* Holonomic - non-Holonomic
  * Holonomic - can move in any direction
* Manipulator Arm
  * Degrees of freedom
  * Coordinate transforms

## Sensors

### LiDAR
* Rotates and uses a laser to measure distance to nearest obstacle
* Returns a vector of values corresponding to the directions
* LiDAR's can operate in 2d (scan) or 3d (point cloud), ours is 2d
<%= callout("Limitation", " Operates in a plane, like a disk. Can't detect an obstacle above or below the plane!") %>

### Visual Cameras
* Webcam sees a color picture
* Matrix of dots, each dot has a color
* Dot[x,y] = {r,g,b}
* Data can be processed for example with `opencv`
* A lot of data and a lot of processing
* Bandwidth limits

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Depth Cameras
* Like a Microsoft Kinect
* In addition to {r,g,b} also has distance so we get {r,g,b,d}
* Useful for getting range measurements of an object detected through camera

### Computation



* Our Turtlebots have:
  1. Arduino to control the motor. Also with various sensors, lights, and i/o ports. Board is from Robotis and is called OpenCR
  1. Raspberry Pi which runs Ubuntu Mate and ROS
* Distributed environment, typically:
  1. ROSCORE running on our roscore1.cs.brandeis.edu
  1. Some ROS nodes running on Raspberry Pi
  1. More Ros nodes running on a laptop or other computer
* Workload is truly distributed across all of those
* Eventually we may have to have a much beefier computer running all three
* This would make the robot much more independent

### Simulators
* Software to allow work even without actual robots
* A series of nodes which:
  * publish topics that a robot would publish (e.g. /odom)
  * Subscribe to topics that a robot would (e.g. /cmd_vel)
  * Uses a "physics engine" to simulate what would happen in the real world
* For example, simulator
  * Maintains an imaginary x,y where the robot is right now
  * Uses 3-d dynamic model of the robot
  * Has 3-d models of obstacles like walls
  * Changes all these states based on motion commands it receives
  * Of course, much more complex
<%= callout("NB", " We will NOT be using simulators called STAGE or STDR") %>
* Gazebo
  * Really sophsticated 3d simulator plus visualization
  * Can do much more than Turtlebots
  * I have seen Gazebo models of a complete Amazon Warehouse Floor
  * With multiple Robots running around
* RViz
  * While it looks similar, it is not a simulator
  * It "simply" visualizes topics that it subscribes
  * In a 3-d space

## Metrics

* What is a metric? Examples?
* Why do we care?
* You can't manage what you don't measure
* What gets measured gets managed
* Standard accounting metrics don't work - there's no revenue yet!
* Look here for lots of details: <%= link_to_topic :ch7%>

#### Vanity vs. Actionable metrics
* Having more users today than I did last week is not enough
* You need to know what you are trying to optimize for
* Then you need to figure out what changes improve those variables
* Only then can you tell if it's a good thing that you have more users today!

### Useful Metrics are
* Actionable: You know how you can put them to use
  * You can use them to figure out what to do, or what you did, to cause the change.
  * Need to know what to do to get more of that result
* Transparent: Publish metrics to the team
* Accessible: Make the definition of what's being measured clear. No made up words or jargon.
* Auditable: Make it easy to see the underlying raw data

### But, beware of 'vanity metrics!'

* More users today than yesterday? Not enough.
* How do I change it. What changes will affect what metrics?
* You can make changes, but will they matter to customers?

## Whats a good metric?

### Qualitative
* Usability Testing, Session Monitoring
* Watch what users do, figure out problems and solutions from small samples

### Quantitative
* Traffic Analysis, User actions
* Track and report what users do, usage and conversion %'s for all or empirical sample of users (see cohort analysis)

### Comparative

* A/B and multivariate testing
* Compare what users do in one scenario vs. other
* Features, Visuals, Colors, Prices, etc.

## Metrics

* You can't manage what you don't measure. What gets measured gets managed
* Vanity vs. Actionable metrics
	* The fact that I have more users today than I did last week doesn't mean that much
	* You need to know what you are trying to optimize for
	* Then you need to figure out what changes improve those variables
	* Only then can you tell if it's a good thing that you have more users today!
* Useful Metrics are
	* Actionable:
		* You can use them to figure out what to do, or what you did, to cause the change.
		* Need to know what to do to get more of that result
	* Transparent: Publish metrics to the team
	* Accessible: Make the definition of what's being measured clear. No made up words or jargon.
	* Auditable: Make it easy to see the underlying raw data
* But, beware of 'vanity metrics!'
	* More users today than yesterday? Not enough.
	* How do I change it. What changes will affect what metrics?
	* You can make changes, but will they matter to customers?
<%= discussion_box "Each team, sitting together. Discuss What are some examples of metrics for your product? How could we tell if they are vanity or not? Take 10 minutes and then we will discuss." %>

How can we tell how we are doing? We need metrics.

* Qualitative
  * Usability Testing, Session Monitoring
  * Watch what users do, figure out problems and solutions from small samples
* Quantitative
  * Traffic Analysis, User actions
  * Track and report what users do, usage and conversion %'s for all or empirical sample of users (see cohort analysis)
* Comparative
  * A/B and multivariate testing
  * Compare what users do in one scenario vs. other
  * Features, Visuals, Colors, Pricaes, etc.

  * Landing Page and call-to-action

title: Ideas are cheap
---
* Everyone has a million ideas
  * Few know how to turn the idea into a successful product or service
  * Venture capitalists say: "It's all about the team!"
  * Execution is far more important than the idea
  * The important role of "Domain Expertise" (what is that?)
* **What is your definition of 'successful?'**
* So: Don't be so secretive!
  * This is a classic trap!
  * You (almost) always gain more from sharing your idea and getting feedback
  * Keeping it secret usually only provides an  imaginary competitive advantage

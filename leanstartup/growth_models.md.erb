<%= callout("Key Idea", "Growth models explain how new customers come from the action of past customers.") %>

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Principles

* Excludes one-time campaigns and actions
* Systematic: built into the product's usage
* Comes from actions of past and existing users or customers
* There are many ways in which using a product can lead to a growth in revenue
  * Word Of Mouth (people recommend your product to others)
  * Side Effect of Usage (people see you using and want to use it too. Or in order to benefit you have to invite.)
  * In-product purchases (part of the experience of the product requires you to spend money inside it.)
  * Subscription (or need to re-buy) (access charges, periodicals, expiration or consumption.)
  * Funded advertising (When advertising gets more users, and is funded from revenue from users.)

### Engine of Growth

* We know that without growth we don't have a business
* Engine of Growth is a way to reason and organize thinking around this
* It is the mechanism whereby a startup means to achieve susstainable growth
* The focus of the analysis is around the *metrics* that are necessary
* The Metrics not only tell you whether you will grow but guides to where to invest to grow

## Four example growth models

<slide_break></slide_break>


### Sticky Engine of Growth

* Concept: A subscription model that needs to be renewed

#### Metrics

* Customer acquisition rate (new customers per unit time)
* Churn rate (customers lost per unit time)
* Customer retention rate

#### Rule

* Rate of new customer acquistion exceeds the churn rate then the company will growth

<slide_break></slide_break>

#### Sticky Engine of Growth: Focus

* Attracting new customers and retaining the ones you have
* Understand why a customer did not renew the service and address those issues.

#### Example

* Home cleaning application and service
* Inherent in the service is that the house will need cleaning periodically
* The service is inherently sticky

### Viral Engine of Growth

<slide_break></slide_break>

#### Concept
* Simple normal use of the product leads to new sales
* Powered by a "viral loop"

<slide_break></slide_break>

#### Key Metrics
* "Viral Coefficient" - how many new customers a single customer brings in, and over what period
* Viral coefficient should be > 1 to get exponential growth

<slide_break></slide_break>

#### Focus

* Increase the viral coefficient
<slide_break></slide_break>

#### Example

* Dropbox: strong incentive of a new user to invite additional users
* Users were given an incentive to do this, more free diskspace

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Paid Engine of Growth

<slide_break></slide_break>

#### Concept

* Simple paid product
* Still need to pay attention to metrics!

<slide_break></slide_break>
#### Key Metrics

* Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): How much does a single customer bring in over their lifetime (as long as they use the product)
* Customer Acquisiton Cost (CPA): How much (in sales costs, advertisting, etc.) does it cost to acquire a single customer
* Growth depends on the simple ratio of customer acquisition cost vs. per customer earnings

<slide_break></slide_break>

#### Focus

* LTV of a customer tells you how much you can spend on customer acquisition
* Simply add more money to customer acquisition and you get a predictable amount of earnings from that.

<slide_break></slide_break>

#### Example

* Ad costs $100 and it predictably causes 2 customers to sign up. CPA = $50.00
* Average customer spends $25 per year and lasts an average of 1.5 years). LTV = $37.50
* If LTV > CPA the company grows, because profits can be invested in more ads or sales people

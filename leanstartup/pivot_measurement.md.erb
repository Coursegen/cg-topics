title: Measure the effect of a pivot

## Measuring effect of a pivot

* The crux of pivoting is having metrics on which to base the decision
* Identify the key 'stages' in users' interaction with the product.
* Each stage needs to be somehow measurable!
* Example:
  1. Registration (sign up)
  1. Activation  (log into account, verify user is registered voter, etc.)
  1. Participation (add content, write a review, etc.)
  1. Retention (log in a second, third, etc. time)
  1. Referral (invite friend, recruit your network, etc

* These are not arbitrary or generic
* They are specific to your product or service
* And they will figure directly into your eventual business model

### Try it yourself

* Discuss the crucial stages in user's experience with your product 
or service
* An imaginary business?

  1. Respond to a survey asking for contact information
  1. Attend an info session
  1. Sign up for a first course
  1. Complete the course and take the final exam

### Team breakout rooms - 15 minutes

* For your business, list them on [this jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1DK3zA18LcHlN27GnC03-haicNWynaMzWTxopklP4pKw/edit?usp=sharing)
* Take one "page" for each group
* Put the product name and the members present at the top
* List each stage as specifically as you can.

### Stages

* Metrics... Metrics... Metrics
* You also need a way to measure how many people make it to each step
* Without metrics your pivots are a shot in the dark
* Once you have a baseline
* Do the pivot
* Quickly determine if you improved where you expected to improved

## Key Lessons from Lean Startup Chapter 4 and 5
* Identify parts of your plan that are not facts but assumptions
    * Requires critical and careful thought
* Create cheap and quick “experiments” to validate or invalidate assumptions (see Concierge MVP)
* Don’t just think and plan, instead experiment and measure
* 4 Questions
    * Do consumers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve?
    * If there was a solution, would they buy it?
    * Would they buy it from us?
    * Can we build a solution for that problem?
* Critical importance of “seeing for yourself”, “getting out of the building”
